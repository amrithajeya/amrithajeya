Hi there! My name is Amritha and I am a highly driven young professional with a skillset of problem solving, analysis and strong attention to detail. 
I am currently in my final year of studying a double degree in Applied Finance and Business Analytics at Macquarue University and hope to utilise my business analytics skills in the field of finance and investment.
